## Detailed Description

### Who is this for?

This quickstart guide is designed for:

- **Financial technology teams** implementing AI-driven transaction monitoring solutions
- **Solution architects** evaluating AI-powered anomaly detection platforms
- **Organizations** looking to provide personalized spending insights to customers

### The business case for AI-driven transaction monitoring

Many organizations are working to enhance customer experience through AI-powered financial monitoring. The Spending Transaction Monitor demonstrates how to combine modern AI/ML frameworks with real-time data processing to deliver personalized, user-centric financial alerts.

The key value propositions for implementing AI-driven transaction monitoring include:

- **Reduced anomaly exposure.** Real-time alerts help customers identify unauthorized transactions quickly, reducing financial losses and improving trust.
- **Enhanced customer experience.** Users define alerts in plain natural language, making the system accessible to non-technical users.
- **Personalized insights.** Behavioral AI analysis detects anomalies based on individual spending patterns, not just static thresholds.
- **Location-aware security.** GPS-based anomaly detection adds an additional layer of protection by comparing transaction locations with user whereabouts.
- **Multi-channel notifications.** Alerts are delivered via email or SMS, meeting customers where they prefer to receive information.

### Example use cases

Transaction monitoring scenarios suitable for this system include:

| Category              | Example Trigger                                                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Spending Pattern**  | "Your dining expense of $98 is 45% higher than your average of $67 over 30 days." |
| **Recurring Payment** | "Netflix charged $18.99 this month vs. your usual $15.49 — a 22% increase."       |
| **Location-Based**    | "Transaction in Boston detected. Your last known location was Los Angeles."       |
| **Merchant-Based**    | "Uber ride was $47.89, up from your last 5 ride average of $28.40."               |

### Sample data

This project uses sample credit card transaction data from the [Credit Card Transactions Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/priyamchoksi/credit-card-transactions-dataset) on Kaggle for demonstration and testing purposes.

### Transaction monitoring implementation

The transaction monitoring use case is implemented by combining the following components:

- **NLP Rule Parser** that converts natural language rules into structured SQL queries
- **Transaction Evaluation Engine** that processes incoming transactions against active rules
- **Behavioral Analysis Module** that detects anomalies based on spending patterns
- **Location-based Security** that compares transaction locations with user GPS data
- **Multi-channel Notification Service** that delivers alerts via email or SMS

**Key Features:**

- Users create alert rules (amount, merchant, category, timeframe, location; notification methods: email/SMS/push/webhook)
- Location-based anomaly detection captures user GPS coordinates for enhanced security monitoring
- Incoming transactions are stored and evaluated against active rules, including location-based risk assessment
- Triggered rules produce alert notifications which are delivered via configured channels

**Example Conversation: Creating an Alert Rule**

> **User:** "Alert me if I spend more than $500 in one transaction"
>
> **System:** ✓ Rule validated and created. You'll receive email notifications when any single transaction exceeds $500.

> **User:** "Alert me if my dining expense exceeds the average of the last 30 days by more than 40%"
>
> **System:** ✓ Rule validated. This rule compares each dining transaction against your 30-day dining average and alerts when spending is 40% above normal.

### Customizing for your use case

To adapt this quickstart for your specific transaction monitoring needs:

- Modify the NLP prompts in `packages/api/` to handle domain-specific rule types
- Add new transaction categories in `packages/db/` for your industry
- Create custom evaluation metrics in `packages/evaluation/`
- Build additional notification channels (Slack, webhook integrations)
- Integrate with your existing transaction data sources

## Deploy

This section walks you through deploying and testing the Spending Transaction Monitor.

### Clone the repository

First, clone and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rh-ai-quickstart/spending-transaction-monitor.git
cd spending-transaction-monitor
```

**Expected outcome:**

- ✓ Repository cloned to local machine
- ✓ Working directory set to project root

### Container Deployment (Recommended)

**See Mac M Series [Installation Troubleshooting](./AppleSiliconPodmanSetup.md)**

#### Step 1: Start with Podman Compose

**Start with pre-built images:**

```bash
make run-local
```

**Build and run from source:**

```bash
make build-run-local
```

**Expected outcome:**

- ✓ All containers started successfully
- ✓ Services accessible at their respective URLs

**Container URLs:**

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- API: http://localhost:3000/api/\* (proxied)
- API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
- SMTP Web UI: http://localhost:3002
- Database: localhost:5432

#### Step 2: Set up data

After starting services, set up the database and Keycloak:

```bash
pnpm setup:data       # Complete setup: Start DB + migrations + seed all data
pnpm seed:all         # Just seed data (DB + Keycloak) - migrations already run
pnpm seed:db          # Seed only database
pnpm seed:keycloak    # Setup only Keycloak realm

# Or using make
make setup-data       # Complete data setup: Start DB + migrations + all data
```

**Note:** `pnpm setup:data` now automatically starts the database, so you don't need to run `pnpm db:start` separately.

📖 **See [DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for complete seeding documentation**

**Expected outcome:**

- ✓ Database migrations applied
- ✓ Sample data loaded
- ✓ Keycloak realm configured (if using authentication)

#### Step 3: Choose authentication mode

The application supports two authentication modes:

**Production Mode (Default) - Keycloak OAuth2/OIDC**

By default, the application uses **Keycloak** for secure authentication:

- **Automatic Setup**: Keycloak realm and test users are automatically created on startup
- **OAuth2/OIDC Flow**: Implements OpenID Connect with PKCE for secure authentication
- **Automatic Token Refresh**: Tokens are automatically refreshed before expiration
- **Test Users** (for authentication testing, no sample data):
  - `testuser@example.com` / `password123` (Regular user)
  - `admin@example.com` / `admin123` (Admin user)
- **Sample Users** (with transaction data - use these to explore the app):
  - `monica.cohen@example.com` / `password123`
  - `barbara.taylor@example.com` / `password123`
  - Plus 48 more seeded users with realistic transaction histories

**Access Points:**

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (redirects to Keycloak login)
- Keycloak Admin: http://localhost:8080 (admin / admin)
- API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

**Development Mode - Auth Bypass**

For local development, you can bypass authentication:

```bash
# Set environment variables for bypass mode
BYPASS_AUTH=true VITE_BYPASS_AUTH=true VITE_ENVIRONMENT=development make build-run-local
```

In bypass mode:

- ✅ No login required - automatic authentication as dev user
- ✅ Yellow "DEV MODE - Authentication Bypassed" banner visible
- ✅ Faster development iteration
- ⚠️ **NOT for production use**

**Switching Between Modes:**

```bash
# Production mode (Keycloak authentication)
make build-run-local

# Development mode (auth bypass)
BYPASS_AUTH=true VITE_BYPASS_AUTH=true VITE_ENVIRONMENT=development make build-run-local
```

**Environment Variables:**

| Variable           | Values                               | Description                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `BYPASS_AUTH`      | `true`/`false`                       | Backend auth bypass                                    |
| `VITE_BYPASS_AUTH` | `true`/`false`                       | Frontend auth bypass                                   |
| `VITE_ENVIRONMENT` | `development`/`staging`/`production` | Environment mode                                       |
| `KEYCLOAK_URL`     | URL                                  | Keycloak server URL (default: `http://localhost:8080`) |

#### Container Management Commands

```bash
make run-local      # Start with registry images
make build-local    # Build images from source
make build-run-local # Build and start
make stop-local     # Stop all services
make logs-local     # View service logs
make reset-local    # Reset with fresh data
```

### Local Development (pnpm)

For local development without containers, use these pnpm commands:

#### Development Mode (Auth Bypass)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm setup

# Start in development mode (auth bypassed)
pnpm start:dev

# Or start individual services
pnpm backend:setup     # Setup database
pnpm backend:start     # Start API (port 8002, auth bypass)
pnpm --filter @*/ui dev # Start UI (port 3000)
```

#### Production Mode (Keycloak)

```bash
# Start with Keycloak authentication
pnpm start:prod

# Access points:
# - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# - API: http://localhost:8002
# - Keycloak: http://localhost:8080
```

#### Container Development

```bash
# With Keycloak authentication (default)
pnpm dev:containers:auth

# With auth bypass (no login required) - fastest iteration
pnpm dev:containers:noauth

# Standard container startup (without rebuild)
pnpm dev:containers
```

**Or using Make directly:**

```bash
# Build and run with Keycloak authentication (default)
make build-run-local

# Build and run with auth bypass (no authentication)
BYPASS_AUTH=true VITE_BYPASS_AUTH=true VITE_ENVIRONMENT=development make build-run-local

# Run without rebuilding
make run-local
```

```

### OpenShift Deployment

> **Note:** Some features in this quickstart require `clusterAdmin` privileges, particularly for enabling and setting up the model registry. See [Required user permissions](#required-user-permissions) for details.

#### Quick Deploy

**Using pre-built images**

```bash
make deploy
```

**Using Quay.io instead of the OpenShift internal registry:**

```bash
# 1) Authenticate to Quay (recommended: use a robot account token)
make REGISTRY_URL=quay.io QUAY_USERNAME=<quay-user-or-robot> QUAY_TOKEN=<token> login

# 2) Build + push to your Quay org + deploy
make REGISTRY_URL=quay.io REPOSITORY=<your-quay-org> IMAGE_TAG=<tag> build-deploy
```

**Using the OpenShift internal registry instead of Quay.io**

```bash
# Login and setup
# IMPORTANT: For OpenShift's internal registry, set REGISTRY_URL once and reuse it.
export REGISTRY_URL="$(oc get route default-route -n openshift-image-registry -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')"
make login
make build-deploy
```

#### Step-by-step Deployment

```bash
# Login and setup
make login
make create-project

# Build and push images
make build-all
make push-all

# Deploy
make deploy
```

**Expected outcome:**

- ✓ Helm chart deployed successfully
- ✓ All pods running
- ✓ Routes created

#### Verify Deployment

```bash
make status           # Check deployment status
make logs-api         # View API logs
make logs-ui          # View UI logs
```

#### OpenShift Management

```bash
make deploy           # Deploy to OpenShift
make undeploy         # Remove deployment
make status           # Check deployment status
make logs-api         # View API logs
make logs-ui          # View UI logs
```

### Testing Alert Rules

After starting the application with `make run-local`, you can test alert rules interactively:

#### List available sample alert rules

```bash
make list-alert-samples
```

Shows all available test scenarios with their descriptions, such as:

- "Alert when spending more than $500 in one transaction"
- "Alert me if my dining expense exceeds the average of the last 30 days by more than 40%"
- "Alert me if a transaction happens outside my home state"

#### Interactive testing menu

```bash
make test-alert-rules
```

This command provides:

- 📋 **Alert Rule Menu** showing alert rule descriptions
- 📊 **Data preview** with realistic transaction data adjusted to current time
- 🔍 **User context** showing the test user profile and transaction history
- ✅ **Confirmation prompt** before running the actual test

#### Example Workflow

1. **Start the application:**

   ```bash
   make run-local
   ```

2. **Browse available test scenarios:**

   ```bash
   make list-alert-samples
   ```

3. **Run interactive testing:**

   ```bash
   make test-alert-rules
   ```

   - Select an alert rule by number (1-16)
   - Review the data preview showing exactly what will be tested
   - Confirm to proceed with the test
   - Watch the complete validation and creation process

#### What the Test Does

The test process:

1. **Seeds database** with realistic user and transaction data
2. **Validates the alert rule** using the NLP validation API
3. **Creates the alert rule** if validation passes
4. **Shows step-by-step results** including SQL queries and processing steps

**Note:** Make sure the API server is running (`make run-local`) before testing alert rules.

### Validating the Alert Notification

After confirming a rule test:

1. The system sends a test notification via the configured **test SMTP server**.
2. To verify:
   - Open the SMTP server Web UI:  
     👉 [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002)
   - Check the inbox for the test email.
   - Open the email to confirm:
     - The **rule name/description** is included.
     - The **transaction details** that triggered the rule are shown.

**Expected outcome:**

- ✓ Email received in SMTP Web UI
- ✓ Alert contains rule description and transaction details
- ✓ Notification delivered within seconds of rule trigger

## Technical Details

### Performance & scaling

**OpenShift Management:**
The Spending Transaction Monitor is designed for scalability using standard Kubernetes and cloud-native patterns. All core components can be scaled using familiar Kubernetes techniques—horizontal pod autoscaling, replica sets, and resource limits.

**Component Scaling:**

- **API Service:** Scales horizontally with multiple FastAPI workers per pod and multiple pod replicas
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with connection pooling and read replicas for high-throughput scenarios
- **UI:** Static assets can be served via CDN for global distribution

**Performance Considerations:**

- Transaction evaluation is optimized for real-time processing
- NLP rule parsing leverages caching for frequently used patterns
- Notification delivery is asynchronous to avoid blocking transaction processing

### Security

Security considerations for production deployments:

- **Authentication:** Keycloak provides OAuth2/OIDC with PKCE for secure user authentication
- **API Security:** All endpoints protected with JWT token validation
- **Database:** Credentials managed via environment variables and Kubernetes secrets
- **Network:** Internal service communication isolated within Kubernetes namespace
- **Sensitive Data:** Transaction data encryption at rest and in transit

**For production deployments, consider:**

- Enabling TLS for all external endpoints
- Configuring network policies to restrict pod-to-pod communication
- Managing secrets through a vault solution
- Implementing audit logging for compliance requirements
